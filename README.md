Like 95% of Notables/Keystones I took from this nice project https://marcoaaguiar.github.io/poe2-tree/ .  
I created my own project because i wanted to add more features on my own + don't know svelte at all + wan't to have control over development speed (I don't sleep) + L + ratio.  
Most small passives I've found by slowly going over every video with skill tree that I could find.  
Some small nodes might be from the older playtest (8 months old i think, maybe 1/3rd of the bottom left small nodes in the map), but newer videos have priority
